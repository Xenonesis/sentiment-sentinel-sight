# Navbar Refactoring Summary

## What was done

Successfully refactored the monolithic `Navbar.tsx` component into smaller, focused components without breaking any functionality.

## New Component Structure

```
src/components/navbar/
├── index.ts              # Barrel exports
├── types.ts              # Shared TypeScript types
├── Logo.tsx              # Brand logo and title
├── NavItem.tsx           # Individual navigation item (desktop/mobile variants)
├── DesktopNav.tsx        # Desktop navigation container
├── MobileNav.tsx         # Mobile navigation with animations
└── MobileMenuButton.tsx  # Mobile menu toggle button
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused independently
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual parts
4. **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to unit test
5. **Type Safety**: Shared types ensure consistency

## Cleanup

- Deleted unused `src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx` component
- Removed unused import from `vite.config.ts`
- All functionality preserved (mobile menu, animations, active states, etc.)

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
- ✅ No unused code remaining
